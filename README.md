## Reinforcement Learning to solve Link's Awakening for the Gameboy
This repo contains code I am using to experiment with RL and creating an agent to play Link's Awakening for the original Gameboy. 

## Requirements
To run this code, place a copy of a Link's Awakening ROM at res/la.gb. As expected, only use ROMs you have ripped from a cartridge you own. The ROM I pulled has an MD5 of `69d643bf4e37b3c133518517338b6a1c` which correlates with the USA Revision 2 release.
